# UBERASM TOOL: LIST FILE
# This is a list of all the code files you're using, and when to run them.



# LEVEL CODE
# Code files in this list will be run in specific levels.

# EXAMPLE:
# To run the code from the file "mycode.asm" in level 105,
# put "mycode.asm" in the "level" folder
# and add an entry to this list saying "105 mycode.asm"
# (without the quotes, and without # in front).

# - You can use the same code file in multiple levels!
# - If you want to use multiple code files in the same level,
#   check https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=faq&page=1515827-uberasm .
# - To run the same code in every level, apply it to game mode 14 (see below).
